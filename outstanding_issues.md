# Outstanding Issues

> Last updated: Mon 3 July 2017

## Performance
The dashboard responsiveness is not as fast as we would like. We will be tuning the underlying Oracle database in order to improve responsiveness, with a goal of ~ instantaneous refresh speed.


## Forecasts
The actualised months of the New Business FY 2018 Q1F forecast (i.e., Feb, Mar, Apr and May) differ somewhat from the actual gross sales volume and AATV (Annualised Average Transaction Value). We are currently investigating the reason for this deviation and will correct if/as appropriate.

The FY 2018 Budget forecast has not yet been included.


## Sales Channels, Marketing Channels and Lead Groups
The mappings of source systems to reported Sales Channels, Marketing Channels and Lead Groups are not yet fully documented, and may change in line with business user feedback.


## Refresh frequency
The New Business reporting is currently refreshed on a weekly basis, following completion of the Trading Week on Wednesday. We will be moving to a daily refresh shortly, once the source data-feeds have been automated.


## Dashboard completion
The New Business Sales Channel and Marketing Channel dashboards are currently missing some of the looks (i.e., charts). These are expected to be in place w/c 3 July.


## Accuracy
Testing is underway to confirm that the reported metrics are accurate, and to document any approximations and deviations from existing reporting.

Known issues are as follows:

| Issue list |
|------------|
| New Business sales undertaken on CATHHIE are recorded as with an "Unknown" sales channel. This will be fixed in the coming weeks once we repoint our CATHIE data source from the Hosking-Slim report to the BIX. |
| Outbound dials corresponding to the "Internet Call backs" lead group are not currently accessible. |
|  Digital Visits and Sales that occur via. the Marketing Channel “Digital Marketing – Breakdown App” will be reported on as the Marketing Channel "Other" |
|  Digital Visits and Sales that occur via. the Marketing Channel “Digital Marketing – AA.com” will be reported on as the Marketing Channel "Digital Marketing – Direct, including MyAA" |
