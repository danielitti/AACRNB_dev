### Date and Time measures

#### Financial Year
The annual period defined for financial reporting, runs from 1 February – 31 January

#### Calendar Year
The annual period used for calendar reporting, runs from 1 January – 31 December

#### Financial Week
The AA defined week number within the Financial Year

#### Calendar Month
The calendar month

#### Transaction Date
The date that the transaction is generated (normally via custromer contact or via system process)

#### Expected cash date
The date that Tiara believes that cash will be received. This may vary from the actual cash date. A deduction is made after the fact if the cash transaction is unpaid.

#### Actual cash date
The date that cash is received in the bank.  This might be the same as the transaction date (for credit card payments), or the policy inception date (for future dated inception dates paid for via. Direct Debit), or approx. 8-10 days from transaction and policy inception date (for immediate inception policies paid for via. Direct Debit).

#### Policy Inception Date
The data the policy first came in to force

#### Policy change inception date
The data that a policy change transaction takes effect

#### Policy change effective date
The maximum of the transaction date and the policy change inception date. The effective date is guaranteed to always be “append only”, i.e., will never be set to a past.

#### Annual Cover Start Date
The date cover commences for each policy year

#### Annual Cover Effective Date
The date cover is effective from for each policy year - i.e. the maximum of the annual cover start date & transaction date for the 1st transaction of each policy year.  The effective date is guaranteed to always be “append only”, i.e., will never be set to a past.

#### Annual Cover End Date
The date the current policy year expires. Also called Expiry Date.

#### Schedule Cover Start Date
The date the current schedule of cover comes in to force

#### Schedule Effective Date
The date the current schedule of cover is effective from - i.e. the maximum of the schedule cover start date & transaction date for the transaction creating the schedule.   The effective date is guaranteed to always be “append only”, i.e., will never be set to a past.

#### Schedule Cover End Date
The date the schedule of cover is effective to

#### Renewal Date
The date the next policy year is due to commence

#### Selected date
Date selected by User (will default to yesterday)

#### Last year selected date
The equivalent day of same the same trading week for last year, (as opposed to the equivalent calendar day of last year)
E.g. If selected date is Tuesday of trading week 51 i.e. Tue January 30, 2018   then Last year selected date will be Tuesday of equivalent trading week of last year ie Tue January 24, 2017
(Note as with Last Year Trading week, below, there is a complication for week 53 in that there is no equivalent week for the previous year so if the selected date is any date between Thu January 25, 2018 and Wed January 31, 2018 then Last year selected date will be taken from week 1 of the current year i.e. Dates Thu January 28, 2017 and Wed February 2 2017. )

#### Financial Year
AA Financial Year starting February 1st. So if selected date is Fri February 2, 2018 then Financial Year will be 2019.

#### Financial Year to selected date
Will be period from 1st February to the selected date.

#### Last Financial Year to date
The comparison between the Financial Year to date and Last Financial Year to date will be performed upon the selected day’s index in the year, so that there is an equal number of days in the Financial Year to date and the Last Financial Year to date.
This approach will correctly account for leap years.
For example, for the Financial year of 2017, the financial year to 3 March 2016 would be compared to the last financial year to 4 March 2015.
This is a change in logic from the legacy MI, which performs a comparison upon date in month, e.g.., 3 March TY to 3 March LY.

#### Trading week up to selected day
Trading week is the period starting from the Thursday before the selected date until the selected date.

#### Last Year Trading week up to selected day
The comparison between a Trading Week in this year and last year will be performed by comparing a given day of this year’s trading week against the same day of the equivalent week of last year.
This is as per the legacy MI, e.g., Week 10 FY 2018 is compared with Week 10 FY 2017.
There is a complication for week 53 which occurs every 7 years or so and is due to happen at the end of the current financial year.
Our proposal is that, since there is no equivalent week 53 for last year, the TW LY fields will report week 1 for current year when we are reporting on TW 53.

~~~~
Current Year                 Last Year
2018 WK 52                   compares to 2018 WK 52
2018 WK 53                   compares to 2018 WK 1 (see above)
2019 WK 1                    compares to 2018 WK 1
~~~~

#### Calendar Month to selected date
The period between the first of the month and the selected date

#### Last Year Calendar Month to selected date
The period between the first of the month and the selected date equivalent for last year. So if selected date is 23 Feb 2018 then Last Year Calendar Month to selected date will be 1 – 23 Feb 2017.
