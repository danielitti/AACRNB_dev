## Specific AA Looker functions
Please note that the Looker dashboards date are set to the last Wedneday as default; this will apply to all days except for Thursday when data is refreshed within Looker. Consequently Thursday is defaulted to the previous week as a precaution for any issues that may arise during data reload.

The screenshot below shows the default position and how you are able to change to a desired date of your choice:
